Update the application release version across the codebase and regenerate all changelog-related files.

**Input**: Version string (e.g., `1.0.1`). Must be provided by the user in the command or message. If omitted, show an error message and STOP.

**Steps**

1. **Extract the version**

   Parse the version string from the user's message or command. The version should match the pattern `X.Y.Z` (three numeric segments separated by dots). Examples: `1.0.1`, `2.0.0`.

   **If no version is provided** (the user did not include a version string in their message):
   - Display the following error message and STOP:
     ```
     ERROR: No version provided.
     Usage: /release-version <version>
     Example: /release-version 1.0.1
     ```
   - Do NOT proceed with any of the steps below.

2. **Update version in `pyproject.toml`**

   Read `pyproject.toml` and find the line containing `version =`.

   Replace the current value with the new version string:

   ```
   version = "<new-version>"
   ```

3. **Update version in `specmetrics/__init__.py`**

   Read `specmetrics/__init__.py` and find the line containing `__version__ =`.

   Replace the current value with the new version string:

   ```
   __version__ = "<new-version>"
   ```

**Output On Success**

```
Release version updated to <version>

Files updated:
- src/flowscope/__init__.py (__version__)
- flowscope.spec

Commentary: openspec-changelog skill can now be used manually to update the changelog files.
```

**Output On Error**

```
ERROR: No version provided.
Usage: /release-version <version>
Example: /release-version 1.0.1
```

**Guardrails**

- Always validate that a version string was provided before making any changes
- Do NOT guess or auto-generate a version — the user must supply it explicitly
- The version format should follow `X.Y.Z` (e.g., `1.0.1`)
